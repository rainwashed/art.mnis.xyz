## Criteria A: Investigation

I started off this project by finding peers and figuring out the items that we (combined) would use in our still-life photo. Next, our group tried different poses and locations of the object to find the one that we liked and that wouldn't be too difficult to illustrate. We settled on using a laptop, book, teddy bear, and speaker; each item being individual to at least one of our group members but also having **variety** yet **unity**. The items were all different from each other, but all items served a purpose in describing the story of the image. The teddy sat on top of the book like a seat. The teddy was watching the laptop while listening to music using his speaker; it all told a story and no item felt "out of place" nor "random" in relation to all the items. After the image was taken and selected, I began sketching the largest **shapes** and eventually the main details of the artwork. After finishing the sketch and outline, I began using charcoal to finish the project. The charcoal allowed for control over the **value** of the artwork; I began to draw in the shadows, the highlights, etc. The white charcoal allowed for massive amounts of **contrast** which I found very useful, especially in developing highlights or the drawing of my book cover.

## Criteria B: Developing

I believe this artwork has allowed for a lot of growth in both my confidence as an artist and my knowledge of techniques of art. My first experience with charcoal was poor because I hated the mess that it made on my hands and in my art journal; I still think it is a messy art form but I also believe it can be used for great artwork. I also learned a lot about value control, both overall and with the charcoal; my initial drawings with charcoal lacked a lot of value because it was very difficult for me. Also, before this project, I lacked a lot of confidence in my own artwork (I am not the type to think too highly of my art), but a lot of people said my art looked good and it made me a lot more confident in my overall ability as an artist.

## Criteria C: Creativing/Performing

I was inspired by my friends who have done art for a lot longer and are a lot better than me. They knew how to use charcoal and made very realistic and dimensional artwork, and it gave me the inspiration to try charcoal and try to make it realistic with highlights and shadows. I definitely learned a lot about charcoal from this project such as the techniques to make it lighter and darker, alongside its powerful use for the creation of shadows. I learned a lot about blending from this project such as the benefit and negatives of using blending stumps and alternative blending tools; the table in my artwork was mostly blended with paper towels which allowed for a more smooth look overall. If I were to do this project again, I would definitely do the table a lot earlier in the project; it was one of the last things I had done. As a result, I personally find it slightly messy, but maybe that is my style. I also would have rather not do the teddy bear because fur is something too difficult for my current skill set to draw - the bear in my drawing looks very smooth rather than "furry".

## Criteria D: Evaluating

As a whole, my artwork serves as a form of self-expression for both me and my group members. The artwork was filled with our items, each of them representing ourselves in some form. My personal item was the book, which was a book about computer programming, which is really representative of my interests and what I wish to be in the future. My group members also have this form of self-representation through these items. I find this artwork a glimpse into my character alongside my group as well.
