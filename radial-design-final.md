## Preamble

- Title: The one who is conscious
- Subject Matter: Geometric lines, shapes, and (most importantly) eyes.
- Medium: Paper, ink, Gel-pens
- Project Goals: Learn the creation process of radial designs, the use of print-making in a project, and the use of Gel-pens in a formal piece of artwork.

## Criteria A: Investigating

## Criteria B: Developing

## Criteria C: Creating/Performing

The driving emotion behind my artwork is the emotion/desire of being conscious, that is, understanding the world, one's place in the world, and what it means to live. The work features a lot of geometric design that has it's inspiration roots from the _Al-Nasir Muhammad Mosque_ and its own designs on the inside of the mosque. The desire of being conscious is present with the use of open eyes as being "awake", which has the figurative meaning of being conscious. This artwork is geometrically simple and minimalistic, qualities that I learnt about myself throughout this project. This project taught me my own desire to be minimal and to be simple, both in the things that I draw, and more importantly, in life. The more things one adds to his life, the more complex it will become. However, this project was not 120% perfect and so if I were given the chance to re-do this project, I definitely would re-do my prints to make them more consistent and make the lines that I carved in the stamp to be more straight.

## Criteria D: Evaluating

I personally believe that the reason that I made this artwork was: to question, to self-express, and for decoration. This project fundamentally was about my own artstic expression in my own style about the desire of being "conscious". Due to the nature of my own self-expression, this artwork can also be seen as other's questioning my values -- the artwork is odd because the eyes give it character, yet the surrounding of the eye is odd and uncanny; it questions the viewer as to the reason of the eyes. The artwork can also be seen for the use of decoration due to it's simplistic and minimalist design -- it has the ability to blend in with the (typically) very simple and minimal homes that people reside in. Therefore, the artwork has the ability to blend in with the simple background such as a wall, making it effective as a decoration.
