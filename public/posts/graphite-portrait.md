## Criteria A: Investigating

I initially planned my work by using an image of myself that I took in my bathroom. This image allowed me to gain an idea of the pose and other anatomical structures of my face, and how it would be related to my final illustration (as the image was grid-lined). I was also able to get an idea of the shades and shapes I needed to use in my own artwork as I also had a black and white photo of my photo. My artwork has strong usage of shape, line, and value. The shape was mostly the shapes of my facial structures like mouth, eyes, ear, nose, etc. I also used a lot of value to detail the differing shades of my face, to create form and 3d. Due to the fact that this was a graphite piece of work, different values allowed me to create different shapes that would appear 3d on the paper. My artwork has unity across my entire artwork, as each shape and part of my face is drawn deliberately (to match my reference photo and my own face).

## Criteria B: Developing

This was a strong change from the start of the unit because, at the start of the unit, I did not know anything about drawing facial structures and other anatomical structures. The most challenging moments was trying to get the shade just right. The shade had to be precise to look realistic, as a small difference in the shade could throw off the entire form of my image. This was very tedious and, although I tried my best to make it look replicated, it still wasn't perfect. This artwork was very similar to my plans as technically the image from my plans was just being redrawn by hand and with graphite.These plans kept me motivated and kept me from making mistakes and drawing things to what my unartistic mind would think. It gave me a sense of order and what I should do, as the grid lines told me a lot of what should go where, etc. Finally, the media studies helped a lot by teaching me techniques and science behind the drawings of anatomical structures. I would eventually use in my final piece of artwork.

## Criteria C: Creating/Performing

The inspiration for my artwork can't be traced to a single image or person. I would rather say that the inspiration for my artwork is myself. Our media studies focused on Greek architecture and statues, not illustrations, so it is hard to say that it was inspiration from Greek artwork. What I found interesting when working on this artwork was the immense precision realistic illustrations require. Even if something was just a little bit off, the general image could look warped or "wrong". I tried my best to make everything precise, but I am not a very good artist, and so I made a lot of these small mistakes, which then would make my general image poor. Finally, the largest mistake I made and something that I would change if I could do it again was the fact that I made the image too dark. When I was referencing my black and white photo, the shadows, highlights, whites, and blacks all looked very dark, but I did not take into consideration how these would translate through graphite. As a result, my final image was too dark and it just generally made my skin tone darker than what I actually am. I would change it by lightening my pallet and taking into consideration the difference between graphite and digital photography and how colors and values play into that conversion.

## Criteria D: Evaluating

I believed I used this artwork for self-expression and catharsis. The artwork's focal subject is myself, and the background being the random noise represents the noise around me and within my own mind. It both represents me as a person with my surroundings and internal thought and represents my neutral monotone figure and facial expression. It also represents the noisy state of my mind, with my mind jumping from thought-to-thought, worry-to-worry, etc. and this artwork could be seen as a vent of those frustrations.
