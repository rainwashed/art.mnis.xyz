<h1 align="center">Ceramic Box</h1>

## Criteria A: Investigating

I initially planned this work in my art journal by creating small sketches of a box with icons that represent me. There are four symbols and each represent one of my values in life. The Ï€ represents knowledge. The phoenix represents freedom. The inter-linked chain represents unity/bond. The Philosophers Stone represents intellect. Most importantly however, the eye represents consciousness as no other value can exist if one is not conscious to existence. I put a lot of emphasis on the **form** of the artwork as that was the most important element to me; it is what was used to create the box, the symbol shapes, etc. I also decided to paint the box black to show **contrast** with my symbols, emphasizing their importance.

## Criteria B: Developing

This medium has allowed me to grow in my skills with clay. Initially, before doing this unit, I had no knowledge of clay's techniques nor any skill with it. Though, I still do not feel my skill in clay is that good, but I must say it has improved since when I first entered. I believe it was very challenging designing the clay. Clay has a unique texture and so my illustrations inscribed in the clay did not come off that well. I also think, holistically, my design from the beginning was a poor and dull idea -- a simple box with some silly icons draw on them. My design in the end came out pretty close to the way I wanted and I don't believe I had to make too much change in the process. I definitely had to adjust the eye symbol to something that can be used as a handle to fix the "box" criteria. Overall, I feel that I have learned a lot from doing this unit.

## Criteria C: Creativing/Performing

The inspiration for my project mostly came from myself. The design is very simple. The inspiration for my icons came from both my own knowledge of the symbols' meanings, but also a lot came from shows and/or games. For example, the _philosopher's stone_ came from Harry Potter, and the symbol for the interlinked-chain had inspiration from my old school's sports icon, which was an intertwined D and C (for DCDS). Over the course of this project, I learnt a lot of interesting tricks to make this thing work. I do think that with this project, I worked alone and without advice (a mistake) -- this was before I made a lot of friends in the art class. I believe that I would had done thinner walls and a more intricate design if I were given the opportunity to re-do this artwork; I believe that my project was too simple, boring, and wasn't executed quite well. The overall design was basic and I wish I could had expressed my values in a more creative way.

## Criteria D: Evaluating

I believe the function of my art was to be an outlet of _self expression_. The symbols on the artwork functioned as my values for my life. I don't believe my art had much other uses, though it could be considered decoration; I don't think so because I do not think my artwork looks that well. Overall, it was an artwork when I was very new and right into art -- the design wasn't there nor the artistic mindset. I believe that, although I tried, the _self expression_ aspect is only basic and not intricately placed. I hoped I could had made the artwork better and more self explaining.
