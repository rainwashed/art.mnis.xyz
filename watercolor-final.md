- Title: Mt Everest
- Subject Matter: Form and shape
- Medium: Watercolor paints
- Project Goals: Understanding the usage and techniques of watercolor

## Criteria A: Investigating

I initally planned my work by using reference images of Mt. Everest. These images allowed me to gain an idea of the surrounding and how tall Mt. Everest stands in relation to the other mountains that surround it. I was also able to get an idea of the colors and shapes I needed to use in my own artwork. My artwork has strong usage of: shape, color, and value. The shape were mostly the shapes of the mountains and the clouds, since the other parts of the image would just be space in reference to the actual image. I also used a lot of color to detail the rich sky hue that was a gradient from a blue to a yellow to a purple, which I thought was very cool. Due to the fact that this was water color, different values allowed me to have more control over the color since the color pallate only included ~16 colors, but because I could modify the value by layering or mixing colors, I was able to create more rich colors of different variety and variance. My artwork had emphasis on the main mountain, Mt. Everest due to it being the largest and also centered within the artwork. There was also both variety and pattern -- a variety in the mountain shape and form but still a pattern in the fact that all of them were mountains along a mountain range.

## Criteria B: Developing

This was a strong change from the start of the unit, because at the start of the unit, I did not know anything about watercolor and watercolor painting techniques. The most challenging moments were when I had put the masking tape onto the paper and having to take it off. The masking tape had too much adhesive and would stick to the texture of the watercolor paper, meaning that the top layer of the paper would rip sometimes when I would take off the masking tape. This was very annoying and, although I tried different ways to make the adhesive less sticky, nearly unfixable. This artwork was very artistically different compared to my plans. My plans were a combintation of multiple photos of different things into one cohesive artwork, but my final piece was a single image I had picked and worked with. This both made it more uniform with the real world as well as allowed for me to focus on detail and percision rather than abstraction. Finally, the media studies helped a lot with teaching me techniques and effects I would eventually use in my final piece of artwork. These techniques, espeically wet-on-wet, allowed me to produce the desired effects present in the original image. Wet-on-wet allowed me to make smooth transitioning gradients that can be seen. Overall, the prelimirary studies allowed for me to learn a lot more about the medium and how to use it most effectively within a piece of artwork.

## Criteria C: Creating/Performing

My inspiration for this artwork came from the mountain painting that ancient Chinese artists would create. I found their artworks with mountains, fog, and the heavens to be serene, calming, and aesthetically pleasing. There is no specific artist or artwork I would credit for this feeling or inspiration, but I would credit the holisitic genre of mountain artwork for this inspiration. I find mountains to be inspiration, a symbolism for: hardship, triumph, success, glamour, and of course, the heavens. It is interesting to me how mountains can represent antanoyoms. Hardship and sucess are antanoyms of eachother, yet a mountain can represent both. Facing a mountain is facing obstucules and hardship, while being on the top of the mountain represents success and triumph. I would definitely not use masking tape if I had to do this project again. The masking tape really made things difficult with its removal and it was just a struggle that I would not go through again. It ruined a lot of the quality of my artwork. Regardless, there is nothing I can do about it once it was already ripped.

## Criteria D: Evaluating

I believed I used this artwork for self expression and catharsis. This artwork symbolizes an excerpt of my life's journey. It shows how I faced struggle and hardship yet triumphed. It showed that, although the land is hard, the sky is beautiful (a methaphoric statement of how the surrounding world is more beautiul than the present situation).
